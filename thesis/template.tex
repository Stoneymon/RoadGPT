\begin{abstract}
The emergence of self-driving vehicles marks a significant change in the automotive industry, with companies like Uber and Waymo leading the way in this new technology. To ensure road safety, it is essential to conduct rigorous testing of these vehicles, especially as they are introduced into live traffic. Field testing can be costly and risky, so most of the testing is done in simulations.

This study aimed to simplify the generation of virtual roads, which is typically reliant on domain models and heuristics. It utilized generative AI to transform textual road descriptions into detailed machine-readable formats. These outputs were then used to create roads automatically within a simulator.

The findings indicated that generative AI holds promise for this application. However, since the model used in this study was not specifically trained for this task, it encountered challenges in certain areas. These issues might be resolved by fine-tuning the current model or developing a new one.
