	abstract={On the first glance, autonomous vehicles seem to be just a simple continuation of the development of assistance systems which help the driver keeping the lane, holding the distance to other vehicles and avoiding accidents, with the vision of avoiding 80{\%} of all accidents, because they are mainly caused by human errors. However, there is huge challenge with respect to the requirements on system performance and reliability for this step. As Herrtwich mentioned in [1], human drivers do quite well in driving a vehicle without accident, with statistically 7.5 million km between accidents on the German Autobahn network; if an assistance system helps a driver to avoid such accidents in (just for example) 9 out of 10 times, it does a good job by reducing the number of accidents by a factor of ten. However, autonomous vehicles with SAE level 3 or higher face the challenge to avoid or control any critical situation within a statistical distance of 75 million km between accidents, in order to achieve a similar performance compared to a level 2 (driver assisted) system. That includes many situations, which have traditionally been handled by human drivers easily, but might be difficult for automation.},

	abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has taken the world by storm, with notable tension transpiring in the field of education. Given that Generative AI is rapidly emerging as a transformative innovation, this article endeavors to offer a seminal rejoinder that aims to (i) reconcile the great debate on Generative AI in order to (ii) lay the foundation for Generative AI to co-exist as a transformative resource in the future of education. Using critical analysis as a method and paradox theory as a theoretical lens (i.e., the “how”), this article (i) defines Generative AI and transformative education (i.e., the “ideas”), (ii) establishes the paradoxes of Generative AI (i.e., the “what”), and (iii) provides implications for the future of education from the perspective of management educators (i.e., the “so what”). Noteworthily, the paradoxes of Generative AI are four-fold: (Paradox #1) Generative AI is a ‘friend’ yet a ‘foe’, (Paradox #2) Generative AI is ‘capable’ yet ‘dependent’, (Paradox #3) Generative AI is ‘accessible’ yet ‘restrictive’, and (Paradox #4) Generative AI gets even ‘popular’ when ‘banned’ (i.e., the “what”). Through a position that seeks to embrace rather than reject Generative AI, the lessons and implications that emerge from the discussion herein represent a seminal contribution from management educators on this trending topic and should be useful for approaching Generative AI as a game-changer for education reformation in management and the field of education at large, and by extension, mitigating a situation where Generative AI develops into a Ragnarök that dooms the future of education of which management education is a part of (i.e., the “so what”).}

	abstract = {Autonomous vehicles (AV) are on a journey from incubation to a widespread usage. A major challenge for self-driving cars to reach widespread usage are guarantees about their safety and reliability. One approach to increasing safety and reliability is testing in simulation. However, simulation-based testing can be beneficial only if the simulations mimic the real-world phenomena. Additionally, AV environments are characterized by high-dimensionality, nonlinearity, stochasticity, and non-stationarity, hence it is difficult in practice to exhaustively list and test all possible scenario variations. While this is a typical state space explosion problem, as usual it is essential to remove un-realistic scenarios from the test space, to reach a more realistic and plausible list of scenario variations. In this work, we present SceVar – a scenario variations database which analyzes real world driving data to extract realistic traffic patterns and driving behaviors which is then used to create massive number of scenario variations for (regression) testing in simulation. In addition, we also envisage that such statistical data can also be used by AV regulatory and testing agencies to certify vehicles for usage in specific operational design domains (ODDs).},

	abstract = {Self-driving cars rely on software which needs to be thoroughly tested. Testing self-driving car software in real traffic is not only expensive but also dangerous, and has already caused fatalities. Virtual tests, in which self-driving car software is tested in computer simulations, offer a more efficient and safer alternative compared to naturalistic field operational tests. However, creating suitable test scenarios is laborious and difficult. In this paper we combine procedural content generation, a technique commonly employed in modern video games, and search-based testing, a testing technique proven to be effective in many domains, in order to automatically create challenging virtual scenarios for testing self-driving car soft- ware. Our AsFault prototype implements this approach to generate virtual roads for testing lane keeping, one of the defining features of autonomous driving. Evaluation on two different self-driving car software systems demonstrates that AsFault can generate effective virtual road networks that succeed in revealing software failures, which manifest as cars departing their lane. Compared to random testing AsFault was not only more efficient, but also caused up to twice as many lane departures.},

    abstract = {Astounding results from Transformer models on natural language tasks have intrigued the vision community to study their application to computer vision problems. Among their salient benefits, Transformers enable modeling long dependencies between input sequence elements and support parallel processing of sequence as compared to recurrent networks, e.g., Long short-term memory. Different from convolutional networks, Transformers require minimal inductive biases for their design and are naturally suited as set-functions. Furthermore, the straightforward design of Transformers allows processing multiple modalities (e.g., images, videos, text, and speech) using similar processing blocks and demonstrates excellent scalability to very large capacity networks and huge datasets. These strengths have led to exciting progress on a number of vision tasks using Transformer networks. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the Transformer models in the computer vision discipline. We start with an introduction to fundamental concepts behind the success of Transformers, i.e., self-attention, large-scale pre-training, and bidirectional feature encoding. We then cover extensive applications of transformers in vision including popular recognition tasks (e.g., image classification, object detection, action recognition, and segmentation), generative modeling, multi-modal tasks (e.g., visual-question answering, visual reasoning, and visual grounding), video processing (e.g., activity recognition, video forecasting), low-level vision (e.g., image super-resolution, image enhancement, and colorization), and three-dimensional analysis (e.g., point cloud classification and segmentation). We compare the respective advantages and limitations of popular techniques both in terms of architectural design and their experimental value. Finally, we provide an analysis on open research directions and possible future works. We hope this effort will ignite further interest in the community to solve current challenges toward the application of transformer models in computer vision.},
